This project is a website developed with Next.js, created as a team effort with Juan Manuel. The website features an engaging landing page that introduces the site's purpose, a contact section where users can reach out through a simple form, and a photo gallery that displays images in an organized and visually appealing way.

The development process used Git for version control, enabling efficient collaboration and seamless integration of features. The site is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across both mobile and desktop devices.
